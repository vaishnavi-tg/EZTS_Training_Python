# Difference between loops and traditional way of coding
# Time taking,more memory, readability,more efforts
# loops are iterative statements
# for 
# while 
# i is variable 
# 'in' is membership operator


for i in "pandey":
    print("morning",i)


for i in "":
    print('morning',i)
print("Hi")        


# for i in 1234:
#     print('morning',i) U ll get error here so u shud use range for this kind of number 
# print("Hi")  

for i in '1234':
    print('morning',i)
print("Hi")
